Project Proposal
===========================================================

```
The goal of my proposed site is to compile a collection of tweets that include one or more of the top-ten misspelled words commonly found on Twitter.
This word bank includes: vicariously, genius, hypocrites, angels, manners, cologne, college and others. At the moment, the navigation of the site will
enable the user to choose words from this bank in order to see relevant tweets that misspell the words, so as to understand the context and person behind
the spelling. Trends of who, why, and where will ideally emerge. 

Personal goals of the project include improving my coding skills, making an aesthetically pleasing site and utilizing new script and HTML
